In approaching software design, the best practice I have learned is to start with understanding the requirements, followed by planning, modeling, prototyping, and iterative refinement. Key steps include defining objectives, creating design plans, and continuously refining based on feedback.
  Working on the 3D scene project enhanced my spatial reasoning, texture mapping, lighting design, and camera control skills. The design process involved requirement analysis, object modeling, texture application, and lighting experimentation, refined iteratively based on visual assessments.
  These tactics, such as modular design, iterative refinement, and prototyping, are valuable for future projects. They ensure quality and functionality through continuous improvement and feedback incorporation.
  When developing programs, the methodology I use is to define objectives, plan structure, code, test continuously, and document thoroughly. For the 3D scene, I introduced camera navigation controls, optimized textures, and experimented with lighting, refining through multiple iterations.
  My coding approach evolved across project milestones, from initial setup to refining models and textures, and finally integrating all components cohesively. Iteration was key in ensuring the final product met the desired standards.
  Computer science enhances problem-solving, technical proficiency, and innovation, opening diverse career opportunities. Computational graphics and visualizations aid in understanding complex concepts and are valuable in the gaming, film, and VR industries. They enhance creativity and innovation in both educational and professional settings.
